# Step 3: Tables

You're probably familiar with object lists in NetBox. This is how we display all the instances of a certain type of object, such as sites or devices, in the user interface. These lists are generated by table classes defined for each model, utilizing the [django-tables2](https://django-tables2.readthedocs.io/) library.

While it would be feasible to generate raw HTML for `<table>` elements directly within the template, this would be cumbersome and difficult to maintain. Additionally, these dynamic table classes provide convenient functionality like sorting and pagination.

:blue_square: **Note:** If you skipped the previous step, run `git checkout step02-models`.

## Create the Tables

We'll create two tables, one for each of our models. Begin by creating `tables.py` in the `netbox_access_lists/` directory.

```bash
$ cd netbox_access_lists/
$ edit tables.py
```

At the top of this file, import the `django-tables2` library. This will provide the column classes for fields we wish to customize. We'll also import NetBox's `NetBoxTable` class, which will serve as the base class for our tables, and `ChoiceFieldColumn`. Finally we import our plugin's models from `models.py`.

```python
import django_tables2 as tables

from netbox.tables import NetBoxTable, ChoiceFieldColumn
from .models import AccessList, AccessListRule
```

### AccessListTable

Create a class named `AccessListTable` as a subclass of `NetBoxTable`. Within this class, create a child `Meta` class inheriting from `NetBoxTable.Meta`; this will define the table's model, fields, and default columns.

```python
class AccessListTable(NetBoxTable):

    class Meta(NetBoxTable.Meta):
        model = AccessList
        fields = ('pk', 'id', 'name', 'default_action', 'comments', 'actions')
        default_columns = ('name', 'default_action')
```

The `model` attribute tells `django-tables2` which model to use when building the table, and the `fields` attribute dictates which model fields get added to the table. `default_columns` controls which of the available columns are displayed by default.

The `pk` and `actions` columns render the checkbox selectors and dropdown menus, respectively, for each table row; these are provided by the NetBoxTable class. The `id` column will display the object's numeric primary key, which is included on almost every table in NetBox but generally disabled by default. The other three columns derive from the fields we defined on the `AccessList` model.

What we have so far is sufficient to render a table, but we can make some small improvements. First, let's make the `name` column a link to each object. To do this, we'll override the default column by defining `name` on the class and passing `linkify=True`.

```python
class AccessListTable(NetBoxTable):
    name = tables.Column(
        linkify=True
    )
```

Also, recall that the `default_action` field on the `AccessList` model is a choice field, with a color assigned to each choice. To display these values, we'll use NetBox's `ChoiceFieldColumn` class.

```python
    default_action = ChoiceFieldColumn()
```

It would also be nice to include a count showing the number of rules each access list has assigned to it. We can add a custom column named `rule_count` to show this. (The data for this column will be annotated by the view; more on this in step five.) We'll also need to add this column to our `fields` and (optionally) `default_columns` under the `Meta` subclass. Our finished table should look like this:

```python
class AccessListTable(NetBoxTable):
    name = tables.Column(
        linkify=True
    )
    default_action = ChoiceFieldColumn()
    rule_count = tables.Column()

    class Meta(NetBoxTable.Meta):
        model = AccessList
        fields = ('pk', 'id', 'name', 'rule_count', 'default_action', 'comments', 'actions')
        default_columns = ('name', 'rule_count', 'default_action')
```

### AccessListRuleTable

We'll also create a table for our `AccessListRule` model using the same approach as above. Start by linkifying the `access_list` and `index` columns. The former will link to the parent access list, and the latter will link to the individual rule. We also want to declare `protocol` and `action` as `ChoiceFieldColumn` instances.

```python
class AccessListRuleTable(NetBoxTable):
    access_list = tables.Column(
        linkify=True
    )
    index = tables.Column(
        linkify=True
    )
    protocol = ChoiceFieldColumn()
    action = ChoiceFieldColumn()

    class Meta(NetBoxTable.Meta):
        model = AccessListRule
        fields = (
            'pk', 'id', 'access_list', 'index', 'source_prefix', 'source_ports', 'destination_prefix',
            'destination_ports', 'protocol', 'action', 'description', 'actions',
        )
        default_columns = (
            'access_list', 'index', 'source_prefix', 'source_ports', 'destination_prefix',
            'destination_ports', 'protocol', 'action', 'actions',
        )
```

This should be all we need to list these objects in the UI. Next, we'll define some forms to enable creating and modifying objects.
