## v3.4.0 (2022-12-14)

!!! warning "PostgreSQL 11 Required"
    NetBox v3.4 requires PostgreSQL 11 or later.

### Breaking Changes

* Device and virtual machine names are no longer case-sensitive. Attempting to create e.g. "device1" and "DEVICE1" within the same site will raise a validation error.
* The `asn`, `noc_contact`, `admin_contact`, and `portal_url` fields have been removed from the provider model. Please replicate any data remaining in these fields to the ASN and contact models introduced in NetBox v3.1 prior to upgrading.
* The `content_type` fields on the CustomLink and ExportTemplate models have been renamed to `content_types` and now support the assignment of multiple content types per object.
* Within the Python API, the `cf` property on an object with custom fields now returns deserialized values. For example, a custom field referencing an object will return the object instance rather than its numeric ID. To access the raw serialized values, reference the object's `custom_field_data` attribute instead.
* The `NetBoxModelCSVForm` class has been renamed to `NetBoxModelImportForm`. Backward compatability with the previous name has been retained for this release, but will be dropped in NetBox v3.5.

### New Features

#### New Global Search ([#10560](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/10560))

NetBox's global search functionality has been completely overhauled and replaced by a new cache-based lookup. This new implementation provides a much faster, more intelligent search capability. Results are returned in order of precedence regardless of object type, and matching field values are highlighted in the results. Additionally, custom field values are now included in global search results (where enabled). Plugins can also register their own models with the new global search engine.

#### Virtual Device Contexts ([#7854](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/7854))

A new model representing virtual device contexts (VDCs) has been added. VDCs are logical partitions of resources within a device that can be managed independently. A VDC is created within a device and may have device interfaces assigned to it. An interface can be allocated to any number of VDCs on its device.

#### Saved Filters ([#9623](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/9623))

Object lists can be filtered by a variety of different fields and characteristics. Applied filters can now be saved for reuse. For example, the query string

```
?status=active&region_id=12&tenant=acme
```

can be saved and applied to future queries as

```
?filter=my-custom-filter
```

Saved filters can be kept private, or shared among NetBox users. They can be applied to both UI and REST API searches.

#### JSON/YAML Bulk Imports ([#4347](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/4347))

NetBox's bulk import feature, which was previously limited to CSV-formatted data for most types of objects, has been extended to accept data formatted in JSON or YAML as well. This enables users to directly import objects from a variety of sources without needing to first convert data to CSV. NetBox will attempt to automatically determine the format of import data if not specified by the user.

#### Update Existing Objects via Bulk Import ([#7961](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/7961))

NetBox's CSV-based bulk import functionality has been extended to support also modifying existing objects. When an `id` column is present in the import form, it will be used to infer the object to be modified, rather than a new object being created. All fields (columns) are optional when modifying existing objects.

#### Scheduled Reports & Scripts ([#8366](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/8366))

Reports and custom scripts can now be scheduled for execution at a desired future time. Background scheduling is handled entirely by the existing RQ workers; there is no need to configure additional tasks to support scheduled jobs. When creating a scheduled job, the user may optionally specify an interval at which the job will run repeatedly (e.g. every 24 hours).

#### API for Staged Changes ([#10851](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/10851))

This release introduces a new programmatic API that enables plugins and custom scripts to prepare changes in NetBox without actually committing them to the active database. To stage changes, create and activate a branch using the `checkout()` context manager. Any changes made within this context will be captured, recorded, and rolled back for future use. Once ready, a branch can be applied to the active database by calling `merge()`. 

!!! danger "Experimental Feature"
    This feature is still under active development and considered experimental in nature. Its use in production is strongly discouraged at this time.
