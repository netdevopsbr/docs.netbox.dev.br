Front ports are pass-through ports which represent physical cable connections that comprise part of a longer path. For example, the ports on the front face of a UTP patch panel would be modeled in NetBox as front ports. Each port is assigned a physical type, and must be mapped to a specific [rear port](./rearport.md) on the same device. A single rear port may be mapped to multiple front ports, using numeric positions to annotate the specific alignment of each.

!!! tip
    Like most device components, front ports are instantiated automatically from [front port templates](./frontporttemplate.md) assigned to the selected device type when a device is created.
