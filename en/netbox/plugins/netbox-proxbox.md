## Introduction

### What is Proxbox?
**Proxbox was created to "mirror" Proxmox on Netbox.** The goal is to make Proxmox GUI unnecessary, allowing to do anything you do on Proxmox GUI, but on Netbox GUI.

<br>

#### Why?
Since I started working with Networking, it always bothered me the amount of softwares and platforms needed to operate the network. Although there is some incredible software that does a lot of things at the same time, it normally is either expensive or vendor-specific.

I think Netbox has the potential to be the brain of the network (or the controller). With the Plugin feature, it makes possible to not necessary replace all softwares and use only Netbox, but integrate it all with Netbox in a way that you can manage your network only using Netbox, one system. With that in mind, I started the work with Proxbox and I expect to collaborate with the community by creating much more Plugins or helping others with their own Plugins.
